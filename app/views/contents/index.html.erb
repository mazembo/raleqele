			Ha-Raleqele Cultural Consultants was established in 1997 in order to provide well-researched, penetrating and realistically sympathetic information and programs on African and South African cultures.  Our purpose is to assist government departments, cultural industries, business, educational institutions, NGOs, performing arts and the media in producing effective programs dealing with cultural diversity and its role in building a new national identity. The founder of Ha-Raleqele Cultural Consultants is David B. Coplan, Ph.D., the Professor and Chair in Anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand. Professor Coplan has also lectured at Cape Town, Paris, Oxford, University of Pennsylvania, Bergen, Basel, Zurich, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ibadan, and Dakar among other universities. His many books and publications, both academic and popular, include In Township Tonight! Three Centuries of South African Black Music and Theatre (2nd edition, Jacana 2007). His partner at Ha-Raleqele is Nonhlanhla Ngwenya, M.A. Heritage, Arts, and Tourism Management (Wits), who has wide consulting experience in private and public cultural industries, institutions, and the media. She currently works for Urban Brew television production studios. 
We offer expert project consultation, live on-site presentations and day-long workshops, script development and writing, and written and audio-visual documentation and reports of all kinds, directed at a full range of popular and specialised audiences.
